# 6. Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
System needs robust error handling for:
- PDF upload and validation
- API request failures
- Prompt management operations
- Report generation
- User experience consistency

## Decision
- Structured error codes and types:
  - PDF errors (invalid format, size, etc.)
  - API errors (timeout, rate limit, auth)
  - System errors (prompt load, storage)
- User-friendly messages with actionable guidance
- Detailed console logging for debugging:
  - Error codes
  - Contextual data
  - Timestamps
- Graceful fallback behaviors:
  - PDF preview fallback to download
  - API retry with backoff
  - Default prompt fallback

## Consequences
✅ Improved user experience during failures
✅ Faster debugging with structured logs
✅ System resilience through fallbacks
❌ Additional error state management
❌ More complex UI state handling
