We are given a query that appears to be a mix of tax forms and data. The user has provided a large block of text that seems to be a combination of various tax forms (Form 941 Schedule B, Form SSA-7050, Form 7004, Form 1120, etc.) and some tax-related instructions. The task is to process this information and generate a tax advisory report in a structured format suitable for React-PDF parsing.

Steps:
1. Identify the key tax forms and data points in the query.
2. Extract relevant information for the report, focusing on:
   - Company details (name, address, EIN)
   - Taxable income, deductions, credits, and tax liability
   - Payments and extensions
   - Other required disclosures
3. Structure the report using Markdown with clear headings, tables, and proper formatting as per the requirements.

   - Payments and credits: $75,858 (Schedule J, line 23)
   - Amount owed: $75,392 (line 36)

Additional forms:
- Form 7004 (Application for Automatic Extension) was filed, indicating an extension request.
- Form 941 Schedule B (for employment tax liability) is mentioned but not filled in the provided data.

We also have:
- Schedule K (Other Information): The company is a tech consulting firm (NAICS 541512), with 100% ownership by an individual (FELICITY JONES) and other details.

Report Structure:
1. **Company Information**: Name, address, EIN, tax year.
2. **Income Summary**: Gross receipts, deductions, taxable income.
3. **Tax Computation**: Total tax, credits, payments, amount owed.
4. **Extensions**: Note on Form 7004 extension.
5. **Ownership and Other Disclosures**: Ownership structure, NAICS code, etc.

Formatting:
- Use Markdown headers (## for section headers)
- Tables for financial data (e.g., income breakdown, tax computation)
- Bold for key terms and values
- Proper alignment (numeric right, text left)
- Dates in YYYY-MM-DD, currency as $XX,XXX, percentages as XX%

Let's build the report accordingly.
