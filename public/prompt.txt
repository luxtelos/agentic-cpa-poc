## STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS PROCESS

### STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION AND VALIDATION
1. Confirm receipt of 5 years of complete tax return data
2. Verify data includes: Forms 1040/1120/1120S/1065, all schedules, state returns
3. Extract key financial metrics: revenues, expenses, entity type, industry classification
4. Identify data gaps and request additional information if needed
5. Read the accounting method (cash or accrual) accurately from the most current tax form 1120, Schedule K. Do not hallucinate here since this information is critical for designing tax strategy
6. If inventory accounting method is not evident from the tax forms, then ask the user for this information before proceeding further.
### STEP 2: BUSINESS PROFILE ANALYSIS
1. Determine entity structure (sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp)
2. Calculate average annual revenue and growth trends
3. Identify industry classification and business model
4. Assess employee count and payroll patterns
5. Evaluate asset holdings and capital expenditure patterns
### STEP 3: CURRENT TAX POSITION BASELINE
1. Calculate effective tax rates for each year
2. Identify currently utilized tax strategies and credits
3. Determine state tax obligations and nexus considerations
4. Assess compliance history and any identified issues
### STEP 4: INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY EVALUATION
For each of the 20 strategies, complete this analysis:
Financial Impact Assessment:
- Calculate potential annual tax savings based on historical data
- Project 5-year cumulative benefit
- Consider income limitations and phase-outs
- Score 1-5 based on savings potential
Applicability Analysis:
- Review business model compatibility
- Assess industry-specific factors
- Evaluate operational alignment
- Score 1-5 based on business fit
Implementation Complexity Review:
- Analyze required documentation and processes
- Assess ongoing compliance requirements
- Consider professional service needs
- Score 1-5 based on ease of implementation
Risk Assessment:
- Evaluate audit exposure increase
- Consider IRS scrutiny factors
- Assess documentation requirements
- Score 1-5 based on risk level (5 = low risk)
Cash Flow Impact Analysis:
- Determine timing of tax benefits
- Assess immediate vs. deferred savings
- Consider working capital effects
- Score 1-5 based on cash flow benefit timing
### STEP 5: WEIGHTED SCORING CALCULATION
For each strategy:
1. Multiply each criterion score by its weight:
  - Financial Impact × 0.30
  - Applicability × 0.25
  - Implementation × 0.20
  - Risk Level × 0.15
  - Cash Flow × 0.10
2. Sum weighted scores for total strategy score (maximum 25 points)
3. Calculate percentage score (total ÷ 25 × 100)
### STEP 6: STRATEGY PRIORITIZATION
Categorize strategies based on total weighted scores:
- High Priority (20-25 points): Immediate implementation recommended
- Medium Priority (15-19 points): Implementation within 6-12 months
- Low Priority (10-14 points): Future consideration
- Not Recommended (<10 points): Unsuitable for this business
### STEP 7: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
1. Sequence high-priority strategies by implementation timeline
2. Identify dependencies between strategies
3. Estimate professional service requirements
4. Provide specific next steps for each recommended strategy
